## Hello (Zdravstvuyte, Bonjour, Hola, Konnichiwa, Nǐ hǎo, Guten Tag, [loading..]), %username%!👋
I am aspiring <b>SWE</b>, like to be curious and tinker around bytes, trying to understand how stuff works in <b>Computer Science.</b>

Our inquiring minds always (or not always :D) want to know: “How does it work from a different perspective, through the eyes of a computer?”
It becomes especially interesting and curious when you start immersing yourself in this world of zeros and ones through games, asking questions like: “How the hell does my character swing a sword?”
So my goal is to understand <b>low-level</b> aspect in <b>CS</b> to write decent performant <b>software</b> and <b>games..</b> :) I'll be walking a long way..

My brain memory allocation currently has such <b>tools</b> in stack:<br>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on growth on my "vocabulairy" in C, using different resources and projects to learn.
- In the future i'd love to use my knowledge to use <b>cpp</b> and <b>Unreal Engine 5</b>
- I'm passionate about colors of life, music and dance: https://www.instagram.com/sleepingzzen/<br>
